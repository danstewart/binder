## Introduction to binder.js

`binder.js` is a lightweight library for building [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

It's primary goals are to:  

- Work well with server-side templated HTML
- Not reinvent the wheel; use existing DOM functionality
- Not require a build step

At [teamweb](https://teamwebhq.com) we use `binder.js` with Flask and Jinja templates.
