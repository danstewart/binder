# Introduction to binder.js

### How it works

Binder is a lightweight library built on top of  [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).  
If you're comfortable with Web Components already then great but if not don't worry, this guide assumes no prior knowledge.

### Goals

-   Work well with server-side templated HTML
-   Not reinvent the wheel; use existing DOM functionality
-   Not require a build step
